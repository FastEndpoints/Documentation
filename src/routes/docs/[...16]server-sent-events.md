[Server Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) can be used to push real-time data down to the web browser in an **async** manner without blocking threads using the **IAsyncIEnumerable** interface like so:


```cs | title="Endpoint.cs"
public class EventStream : EndpointWithoutRequest
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("event-stream");
        AllowAnonymous();
        Options(x => x.RequireCors(p => p.AllowAnyOrigin()));
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        //simply provide any IAsyncEnumerable<T> as argument
        await SendEventStreamAsync("my-event", GetDataStream(ct), ct);
    }

    private async IAsyncEnumerable<object> GetDataStream([EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct)
    {
        while (!ct.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            await Task.Delay(1000);
            yield return new { guid = Guid.NewGuid() };
        }
    }
}
```

In the browser, the event stream can be subscribed to and consumed using the **EventSource** object like so:

```html | title="Index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			const sse = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/event-stream');
			sse.addEventListener('my-event', (e) => console.log(e.data));
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

If you are planning to create more than a handful of server-sent-event streams, it's a good idea to enable **HTTP2** in kestrel and all upstream servers such as reverse proxies and CDNs so that data can be multiplexed between the web server and client using a low number of tcp connections.

Here's a [good read](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/event-driven/2021/04/23/SSE-with-HTTP2.html) on the subject.
