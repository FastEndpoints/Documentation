# In-Process Event Bus Pattern (Pub/Sub)

If you'd like to take an event driven approach to building your application, you have the option to publish events and have completely decoupled **Event-Handlers** take action when events are published. An event can have more than one handler and has a one-to-many relationship. Due to the nature of pub/sub event bus pattern, handlers cannot return any results back to the caller/publisher.

### 1. Define An Event Model/ DTO

This is the data contract that will be delivered to the subscribers/event-handlers.

```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent
{
    public string OrderID { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public decimal OrderTotal { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Define An Event Handler

This is the code that will be executed when events of the above DTO type gets published.

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : IEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderCreationHandler(ILogger<OrderCreationHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"order created event received:[{eventModel.OrderID}]");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

You can create as many implementations of **IEventHandler&lt;OrderCreatedEvent&gt;** as you like, and they all are receivers/subscribers of the **OrderCreatedEvent**.
No other boilerplate (explicit subscription registration) is necessary.

### 3. Publish The Event

Simply hand in an event model to the **PublishAsync()** method.

```cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/sales/orders/create");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CreateOrderRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var orderID = await orderRepo.CreateNewOrder(req);

        await PublishAsync(new OrderCreatedEvent
        {
            OrderID = orderID,
            CustomerName = req.Customer,
            OrderTotal = req.OrderValue
        });

        await Send.OkAsync();
    }
}
```

## The PublishAsync() Method

The **PublishAsync()** method has an overload that will take a **Mode** enum that lets you specify whether to wait for **all subscribers** to finish; wait for **any subscriber** to finish; or wait for **none of the subscribers** to finish.

For example, you can publish an event in a fire-n-forget manner with the following:

```cs
await PublishAsync(eventModel, Mode.WaitForNone);
```

The default mode is **Mode.WaitForAll** which will await all subscribers. I.e. execution will only continue after each and every subscriber of the event has completed their work.

## Publish From Anywhere

It is possible to publish events even from outside of endpoints by marking the event model with the **IEvent** interface, which would provide **PublishAsync()** as an extension method.

```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent : IEvent { ... }
```

```cs
await new OrderCreatedEvent
{
    OrderID = "12345",
    CustomerName = "scarlet johanson",
    OrderTotal = 123.45m
}
.PublishAsync(Mode.WaitForAll);
```

## Dependency Injection

Dependencies in event handlers can be resolved as described [here](dependency-injection#event-handler-dependencies).

## Event Bus Without FastEndpoints

The Event Bus can be used independently of the FastEndpoints library, even with Blazor WASM projects. Simply install the messaging library like so:

```shell | copy
dotnet add package FastEndpoints.Messaging 
```

Register the messaging services with the IOC container as shown in the following console application example:

```csharp | title=Program.cs | copy
using FastEndpoints; //add this
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

var bld = Host.CreateApplicationBuilder();
bld.Services.AddMessaging(); //add this

var host = bld.Build();
host.Services.UseMessaging(); //add this

var appStartedEvent = new AppStarted();
await appStartedEvent.PublishAsync();

await host.RunAsync();

sealed class AppStarted : IEvent
{
    public string Message => "Welcome to the App!";
}

sealed class AppStartedHandler(ILogger<AppStartedHandler> logger) : IEventHandler<AppStarted>
{
    public Task HandleAsync(AppStarted e, CancellationToken c)
    {
        logger.LogInformation("{@msg}", e.Message);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```
