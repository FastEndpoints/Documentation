# In-Process Event Bus Pattern (Pub/Sub)

If you'd like to take an event driven approach to building your application, you have the option to publish events and have completely decoupled **Event-Handlers** take action when events are published. An event can have more than one handler and has a one-to-many relationship. Due to the nature of pub/sub event bus pattern, handlers cannot return any results back to the caller/publisher.

### 1. Define An Event Model/ DTO

This is the data contract that will be delivered to the subscribers/event-handlers.

```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent
{
    public string OrderID { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public decimal OrderTotal { get; set; }
}
```

### 2. Define An Event Handler

This is the code that will be executed when events of the above DTO type gets published.

```cs
public class OrderCreationHandler : IEventHandler<OrderCreatedEvent>
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public OrderCreationHandler(ILogger<OrderCreationHandler> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public Task HandleAsync(OrderCreatedEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        _logger.LogInformation($"order created event received:[{eventModel.OrderID}]");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

### 3. Publish The Event

Simply hand in an event model to the **PublishAsync()** method.

```cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/sales/orders/create");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CreateOrderRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var orderID = await orderRepo.CreateNewOrder(req);

        await PublishAsync(new OrderCreatedEvent
        {
            OrderID = orderID,
            CustomerName = req.Customer,
            OrderTotal = req.OrderValue
        });

        await SendOkAsync();
    }
}
```

## The PublishAsync() Method

The **PublishAsync()** method has an overload that will take a **Mode** enum that lets you specify whether to wait for **all subscribers** to finish; wait for **any subscriber** to finish; or wait for **none of the subscribers** to finish.

For example, you can publish an event in a fire-n-forget manner with the following:

```cs
await PublishAsync(eventModel, Mode.WaitForNone);
```

The default mode is **Mode.WaitForAll** which will await all subscribers. I.e. execution will only continue after each and every subscriber of the event has completed their work.

## Publish From Anywhere

It is possible to publish events even from outside of endpoints by marking the event model with the **IEvent** interface, which would provide **PublishAsync()** as an extension method.
```cs
public class OrderCreatedEvent : IEvent { ... }
```
```cs
await new OrderCreatedEvent
{
    OrderID = "12345",
    CustomerName = "scarlet johanson",
    OrderTotal = 123.45m
}
.PublishAsync(Mode.WaitForAll);
```

## Dependency Injection
Dependencies in event handlers can be resolved as described [here](dependency-injection#event-handler-dependencies).
