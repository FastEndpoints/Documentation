# In-Process Command Bus Pattern

Similarly to the [Event Bus](event-bus), you can take a decoupled, command driven approach with the distinction that a command can only have a single handler which may or may not return a result. Whereas an event can have many handlers and they cannot return results back to the publisher.

## 1. Define A Command
This is the data contract that will be handed to the command handler. Mark the class with either the **ICommand** or **ICommand&lt;TResult&gt;** interface in order to make any class a command. Use the former if no result is expected and the latter if a result is expected back from the handler.
```cs
public class GetFullName : ICommand<string>
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

## 2. Define A Command Handler
This is the code that will be executed when a command of the above type is executed. Implement either the **ICommandHandler&lt;TCommand, TResult&gt;** or **ICommandHandler&lt;TCommand&gt;** interface depending on whether a result needs to be returned or not.
```cs
public class FullNameHandler : ICommandHandler<GetFullName, string>
{
    public Task<string> ExecuteAsync(GetFullName command, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var result = command.FirstName + " " + command.LastName;
        return Task.FromResult(result);
    }
}
```

## 3. Execute The Command
Simply call the **ExecuteAsync()** extension method on the command object.
```cs
var fullName = await new GetFullName()
{
    FirstName = "john",
    LastName = "snow"
}
.ExecuteAsync();
```

## Manipulating Endpoint Error State
By implementing command handlers using the **CommandHandler<>** abstract types instead of the interfaces mentioned above, you are able to manipulate the validation/error state of the endpoint that issued the command like so:

```cs |title=GetFullNameEndpoint.cs
public class GetFullNameEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest<string>
{
    ...

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken c)
    {
        AddError("an error added by the endpoint!");

        //command handler will be adding/throwing it's own validation errors
        Response = await new GetFullName
        {
            FirstName = "yoda",
            LastName = "minch"
        }.ExecuteAsync();
    }
}
```

```cs |title=FullNameHandler.cs
public class FullNameHandler : CommandHandler<GetFullName, string>
{
    public override Task<string> ExecuteAsync(GetFullName cmd, CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        if (cmd.FirstName.Length < 5)
            AddError(c => c.FirstName, "first name is too short!");

        if (cmd.FirstName == "yoda")
            ThrowError("no jedi allowed here!");

        ThrowIfAnyErrors();

        return Task.FromResult(cmd.FirstName + " " + cmd.LastName);
    }
}
```

In this particular case, the client will receive the following error response:
```json |title=json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "One or more errors occured!",
  "errors": {
    "GeneralErrors": [
      "an error added by the endpoint!",
      "no jedi allowed here!"
    ],
    "FirstName": [ "first name is too short!" ]
  }
}
```

## Dependency Injection
Dependencies in command handlers can be resolved as described [here](dependency-injection#command-handler-dependencies).

# Remote Procedure Calls With GRPC

It's possible to have command classes that implement **ICommand&lt;TResult&gt;** live in one server and their respective handler classes (**ICommandHandler&lt;TCommand, TResult&gt;**) located in a completely different remote server. When the commands are executed, they go over the wire to the relevant remote server that hosts the handler. Once the handler execution completes, the result is brought back to the requesting server transparently, as if it was located in the same process. Only difference would be the network latency and the cost of DTO serialization incurred.

This feature is based on Microsoft's **Grpc.Core** package. By default, the communication channel is insecure (unencrypted) for ease of development and transient network errors cause the operations to be automatically retried up to 5 times. See the default channel options [here](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/blob/8efe78a78a4e6ff6c9036750ab0268ac4f6b217a/Src/Messaging.Remote/Client/RemoteConnection.cs#L19-L44). Make sure to set up TLS for the server (that hosts the handlers) as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/aspnetcore?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio#tls) when deploying to production if the servers are not located in the same internal network/vnet. Ideally for speedy communication, consider placing all the servers in the same local network instead of having to communicate over the internet.

## Project Setup
Instead of the traditional GRPC **.proto** files our contracts are defined by the `ICommand` & `ICommandHandler` interfaces. Typically you'd have a multi-project solution with at least 3 projects.

1. **Contracts** - Where the command and result DTOs reside.
2. **Server** - Where the command handlers are hosted.
3. **Client** - Where the command execution is initiated.

### The Shared Contracts Project

This project will only contain the command/result DTOs such as these:
```cs
public class CreateOrderCommand : ICommand<CreateOrderResult>
{
    public int OrderId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
}

public class CreateOrderResult
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
```

And only needs to reference FastEndpoints core messaging library (**netstandard2.1**):
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="FastEndpoints.Messaging.Core" Version="5.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

### The Handler Server Project

This project hosts the command handlers served via Kestrel as GRPC endpoints and it needs to reference the **Contracts** project as well as the FastEndpoints remote messaging library (**net6.0+**).

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\Contracts\Contracts.csproj" />
    <PackageReference Include="FastEndpoints.Messaging.Remote" Version="5.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Implement the handler like this:

```cs
public sealed class CreateOrderHandler : ICommandHandler<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderResult>
{
    public Task<CreateOrderResult> ExecuteAsync(CreateOrderCommand cmd, CancellationToken _)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(new CreateOrderResult()
        {
            Message = $"Order {cmd.OrderId} created for {cmd.CustomerName}"
        });
    }
}
```

Then add the handler server middleware to the ASP.Net pipeline and map/register the individual handlers as shown below:
```cs
var bld = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();

// Accept only HTTP/2 to allow insecure connections for development.
bld.WebHost.ConfigureKestrel(o => o.ListenLocalhost(6000, o => o.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http2));

bld.AddHandlerServer();

var app = bld.Build();

app.MapHandlers(h =>
{
    h.Register<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderHandler, CreateOrderResult>();
});

app.Run();
```

### Client / Command Initiator Project

This application (**net6.0+**) would also need to reference both the **Contracts** project as well as FastEndpoints remote messaging library like so:
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\Contracts\Contracts.csproj" />
    <PackageReference Include="FastEndpoints.Messaging.Remote" Version="5.*" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Then map the remote handler server by specifying it's address and register the commands for that remote connection as shown below:

```cs
var bld = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
var app = bld.Build();
app.MapRemoteHandlers("http://localhost:6000", c =>
{
    c.Register<CreateOrderCommand, CreateOrderResult>();
});
```

:::admonition type=info
A particular type of command can only be associated with a single remote connection (handler server). 
There is no event-bus like broadcast capability. I.e. if you register the same command inside of multiple **MapRemoteHandlers** calls, only the last call will be effective.
:::


You are then able to execute the command as you typically do using the appropriately named **RemoteExecuteAsync()** extension method like so:
```cs
var result = await new CreateOrderCommand
{
    OrderId = 1001,
    CustomerName = "Holly Simms"
}
.RemoteExecuteAsync();
```

### Voila!
That's all there's to it. No need for .proto file creation, service classes or decorating properties of DTOs with attributes. This RPC functionality is mainly geared towards easily moving parts of your FastEndpoints monoliths out to remote servers as microservices without a message broker for synchronous messaging needs. 

With a bit of extra effort/configuration it would be possible to enable a handler server to accept incoming GRPC requests from many hundreds of clients (.Net only - end users who would be the initiators of the commands). You'd be configuring authentication & authorization as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/authn-and-authz?view=aspnetcore-7.0) but it's recommended to just use FE REST Endpoints instead for this purpose.

To be able to make GRPC requests to the handler server's GRPC endpoints from third-party/non-dotnet clients, you can configure **GRPC Reflection** as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/test-tools?view=aspnetcore-7.0).

### Client Streaming & Server Streaming

As with typical GRPC, it's possible to send a stream of items/DTOs to the handler server and get back a result once the stream ends with **Client Streaming**.

With **Server Streaming**, the client sends a single command to the handler server and gets back a continuous stream of results.

Samples of both as well as the full source code for the above example can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Remote-Procedure-Call-Demo).

### Setting Client / Channel Options

[GrpcChannelOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/configuration?view=aspnetcore-7.0#configure-client-options) can be specified at startup like so:
```cs
app.MapRemoteHandlers("http://localhost:6000", c =>
{
    c.ChannelOptions.MaxRetryAttempts = 5;
    c.ChannelOptions.HttpHandler = new() { ... };
    c.ChannelOptions.ServiceConfig = new() { ... };
});
```

### Client Call Options

[CallOptions](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/blob/ff1a07b90c498f259e6d9f4a50cdad7c89ecd3c0/src/Grpc.Core.Api/CallOptions.cs#L42-L47) can be handed to the **RemoteExecuteAsync()** method like so:
```cs
var result = await new MyCommand
{
    ...
}
.RemoteExecuteAsync(new CallOptions(...));
```

### Binary Serializer

[MessagePack](https://github.com/neuecc/MessagePack-CSharp#messagepack-for-c-net-net-core-unity-xamarin) binary serialization is used with it's contractless resolver (eliminates the need for annotating properties) together with Lz4BlockArray compression is to serialize commands/results instead of Protobuf.
