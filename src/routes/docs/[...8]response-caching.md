# {$frontmatter.title}

In order to get response caching working, you need to enable the response caching middleware and define how responses are cached using the **ResponseCache()** method in the endpoint configuration.

This method supports all arguments of the **[ResponseCache]** attribute you'd typically use with mvc except for the **CacheProfileName** argument as cache profiles are not supported.

[See this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/response?view=aspnetcore-6.0) for an intro to response caching in ASP.NET middleware.

```cs |copy|title=Program.cs
global using FastEndpoints;

var bld = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
bld.Services
   .AddFastEndpoints()
   .AddResponseCaching(); //add this

var app = bld.Build();
app.UseResponseCaching() //add thiss
   .UseFastEndpoints();
app.Run();
```

```cs |title=MyEndpoint.cs
public class MyEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("/api/cached-ticks");
        ResponseCache(60); //cache for 60 seconds
    }

    public override Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return SendAsync(new
        {
            Message = "this response is cached"
            Ticks = DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks
        });
    }
}
```

:::admonition type="tip":::
[Output caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output?view=aspnetcore-7.0) features introduced in .NET 7.0 can be added to endpoints via the **CacheOutput(...)** extension method.
```cs
public override void Configure()
{
    ...
    Options(x => x.CacheOutput(p => p.Expire(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60))));
}
```
