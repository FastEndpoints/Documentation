## Integration Testing

### Route-less Testing

The recommended integration/end-to-end testing strategy is to use the following stack:

- [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/)
- [WebApplicationFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests)
- [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)

FastEndpoints comes with a set of extension methods for the **HttpClient** to make testing more convenient in a strongly-typed and route-less manner. I.e. you don't need to specify the route URLs when testing endpoints.

### Walkthrough

The quickest way to get going is to scaffold a starter project using our [Template Pack](scaffolding#project-scaffolding).
If you aren't ready to scaffold a project yet, follow along with the [source code](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/tree/main/templates/project).

```sh title=install & scaffold | copy
dotnet new install FastEndpoints.TemplatePack
dotnet new feproj -n E2EWalkthrough
```

#### Solution Setup

There are two projects in the solution. The main application is in the [Source](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/main/templates/project/Source) folder and the actual test project is in the [Tests](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/tree/main/templates/project/Tests) folder. The main project doesn't reference the test project. The test project [references the main project](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/fb8442282bc9fa462f5e9725e501996d2d9b9adb/templates/project/Tests/Tests.csproj#L20) so it can access the Endpoint/Request/Response classes. The Endpoints and DTOs are internal so we expose internal classes of the main project to the test project via an [assembly attribute](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/fb8442282bc9fa462f5e9725e501996d2d9b9adb/templates/project/Source/Meta.cs#L5).

#### FastEndpoints.Testing Package

Even though you can use the vanilla **WebApplicationFactory&lt;T&gt;** together with the convenient [HttpClient extensions](https://api-ref.fast-endpoints.com/api/FastEndpoints.HttpClientExtensions.html#methods) for sending requests to the WAF, the **FastEndpoints.Testing** package comes with an abstract [App Fixture](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/blob/422567a5a454e5cf103a052276ad2391acfbcf9b/Src/Testing/AppFixture.cs#L43) and [Test Base](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/blob/422567a5a454e5cf103a052276ad2391acfbcf9b/Src/Testing/TestBase.cs#L58) to make testing even more convenient by offering:

- One-time fixture setup & teardown.
- Ability to do ordered test-method execution within a class.
- Sets up xUnit test-output-helper and message-sink.
- Automatically picks up configuration overrides from **appsettings.Testing.json** file.
- Convenient test-service configuration & HttpClient creation.
- Speeds up test execution by preventing unnecessary WAF/SUT instantiations.
- Easy access to fake data generation using [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus).

#### App Fixture

An **AppFixture** is a special type of abstract [class fixture](https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#class-fixture), which in xUnit is simply a shared object that is
instantiated once per each test-class before test execution begins and destroyed after all the test-methods of the class completes execution. It is the recommended
strategy to share a common resource among multiple tests of the same test-class.

An AppFixture when instantiated by xUnit for a test-class, bootstraps an instance of your target application (SUT) as an in-memory test-server/web-host. That instance
will be re-used by all the test-methods of the class speeding up test execution as constantly booting up and tearing down a WAF/web-host per each test-method (or even
per test-class) would result in slower test execution.

To create an AppFixture, inherit from **AppFixture&lt;TProgram&gt;** base:

```cs
public class MyApp : AppFixture<Program>
{
    protected override Task SetupAsync()
    {
        // place one-time setup code here
    }
    
    protected override void ConfigureApp(IWebHostBuilder a)
    {
        // do host builder config here
    }

    protected override void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection s)
    {
        // do test service registration here
    }

    protected override Task TearDownAsync()
    {
        // do cleanups here
    }
}
```

When you create a derived AppFixture, you're uniquely configuring a SUT with its own set of test services & settings. Need another SUT that's configured differently?
Simply create another derived AppFixture. The internal caching mechanism of AppFixtures ensures that only one instance of a SUT is ever booted up per derived
AppFixture no matter how many test-classes are using the same derived AppFixture. For example, if you create 2 derived AppFixtures called **MyTestAppA** and
**MyTestAppB**, there will only ever be 2 instances of your SUT running at any given time during a test run.

The aforementioned caching behavior can be turned off simply by annotating the derived AppFixture class with an attribute, which results in a SUT being booted up per each test-class that depends on it.

```cs
[DisableWafCache]
public class MyApp : AppFixture<Program>
```

If some async work needs to be performed that directly contributes to the creation of the WAF instances, as in the case of using TestContainers, that work
can be performed by overriding the **PreSetupAsync()** method as shown in [this example](https://gist.github.com/dj-nitehawk/04a78cea10f2239eb81c958c52ec84e0).

#### Test Base

xUnit considers a single class file containing multiple test-methods as a single [test-collection](https://xunit.net/docs/running-tests-in-parallel.html#parallelism-in-test-frameworks). A test-collection is a set of test-methods that would be executed serially together, but never in parallel. I.e. two test-methods of the same class will never execute simultaneously. In fact, it's impossible to make it do so. The order in which the methods are executed is not guaranteed (unless we do explicit ordering). Inherit **TestBase&lt;TAppFixture&gt;** to create a test-class. xUnit will inject the derived AppFixture via the constructor.

```cs
public class MyTests(MyApp App) : TestBase<MyApp>
{
    [Fact, Priority(1)]
    public async Task Invalid_User_Input()
    {
        var (rsp, res) = await App.Client.POSTAsync<Endpoint, Request, ErrorResponse>(new()
        {
            FirstName = "x",
            LastName = "y"
        });
        rsp.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
        res.Errors.Count.Should().Be(2);
        res.Errors.Keys.Should().Equal("firstName", "lastName");
    }

    [Fact, Priority(2)]
    public async Task Valid_User_Input()
    {
        var (rsp, res) = await App.Client.POSTAsync<Endpoint, Request, Response>(new()
        {
            FirstName = "Mike",
            LastName = "Kelso"
        });
        rsp.IsSuccessStatusCode.Should().BeTrue();
        res.Message.Should().Be("Hello Mike Kelso...");
    }
}
```

#### Test Ordering

In the above example, tests are ordered by annotating the test-method with the **[Priority(n)]** attribute. Test-methods that don't have an attribute decoration are executed after the ordered tests, while ordered tests are always executed first.

#### HttpClient Configuration

In the above example, a **MyApp** fixture instance is injected by xUnit via the constructor of the test-class, which has a default HttpClient accessible via the **Client** property. You can configure custom clients within test-methods like so:

```cs
[Fact]
public async Task Access_Protected_Endpoint()
{
    var adminClient = App.CreateClient(c =>
    {
        c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new("Bearer", jwtToken);
    });
}
```

Or setup pre-configured clients on the **MyApp** fixture class itself if they won't be modified by individual test-methods:

```cs
public class MyApp : AppFixture<Program>
{
    public HttpClient Admin { get; private set; }
    public HttpClient Customer { get; private set; }

    protected override async Task SetupAsync()
    {
        var apiKey = await GetApiKey(...);
        Admin = CreateClient(c => c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-api-key", apiKey));
        Customer = CreateClient();
    }

    protected override Task TearDownAsync()
    {
        Admin.Dispose();
        Customer.Dispose();
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

#### Request Sending Methods

Extension methods such as **POSTAsync** can be called on the HttpClients to send requests to the web-host. The **POSTAsync** method in the above example has 3 generic parameters.

- The type of the Endpoint class (endpoint's route URL is not needed)
- The type of the Request DTO class
- The type of the Response DTO class

The method argument takes an instance of a populated Request DTO and Returns a record class containing the **HttpResponseMessage** and the **Response** DTO of the
endpoint, with which you can do assertions. There are [other such methods](https://api-ref.fast-endpoints.com/api/FastEndpoints.HttpClientExtensions.html#methods) for
sending requests to your endpoints. If you'd like to understand how these methods work, please see [this comment](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/issues/645#issuecomment-2006193588).

### State Fixture

There's a generic variant **TestBase<TAppFixture,TStateFixture>** you can use to share a common state/resource amongst the test-methods of a test-class. Simply
implement a **StateFixture** and use it with the test-class like so:

```csharp
public sealed class MyState : StateFixture
{
    public int Id { get; set; } //some state

    protected override async Task SetupAsync()
    {
        Id = 123; //some setup logic
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    protected override async Task TearDownAsync()
    {
        Id = 0; //some teardown logic
        await Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

public class MyTests(MyApp App, MyState State) : TestBase<MyApp, MyState>
{
    [Fact]
    public async Task State_Check()
        => State.Id.Should().Be(123);
}
```

This approach allows your test suite to have just a couple of derived **AppFixtures**, each representing a uniquely configured SUT(live app/WAF instance), while each
test-class can have their own lightweight **StateFixture** for the sole purpose of sharing state/data amongst multiple test-methods of that test-class. This leads to better test run performance as each unique SUT is only created once no matter how many test classes use the same derived **AppFixture**.

### Test-Collections & Collection Fixtures

A test-collection is an arbitrary grouping of multiple test-classes which results in all test-methods of the collection running serially (never in parallel) in order to avoid contention between test-methods from multiple test-classes. A test-collection can be thought of as a mega test-class but physically seperated into multiple class files.

An **AppFixture** can be made into a [collection-fixture](https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#collection-fixture) for the purpose of being shared just among the test-classes of a given collection. It will be instantiated before any of the tests from the collection is run and torn down once all tests from the collection is complete. Inherit from **AppFixture&lt;TProgram&gt;** as usual:

```cs
public class AppForCollectionX : AppFixture<Program> {}
```

Next, you need to create a **collection-definition** inheriting from **TestCollection&lt;TAppFixture&gt;**, which is simply a class used to define a test-collection with a unique name/identifier.

```cs
[CollectionDefinition(Name)]
public class CollectionX : TestCollection<AppForCollectionX>
{
    public const string Name = nameof(CollectionX);
}
```

Once there's a collection-definition, create as many test-classes as needed by inheriting the non-generic **TestBase** class and associate them with the test-collection using the **[Collection(...)]** attribute. All test-classes of the same collection will receive the exact same derived **AppFixture** instance via the constructor.

```cs
[Collection(CollectionX.Name)]
public class TestClassA(AppForCollectionX App) : TestBase
{
    ...
}

[Collection(CollectionX.Name)]
public class TestClassB(AppForCollectionX App) : TestBase
{
    ...
}
```

#### Ordering Tests In Collections

Tests can be ordered by prioritizing test-collections, test-classes in those collections as well as tests within the classes for fully controlling the order of test execution when test-collections are involved. You must first enable the feature by adding an assembly level attribute to your test project like so:

```csharp|title="AssemblyInfo.cs"|copy
using FastEndpoints.Testing;

[assembly: EnableAdvancedTesting]
```

All that remains is to annotate the **[Priority(n)]** attribute at the appropriate levels (collection/class/method) like so:

```csharp
[CollectionDefinition(A), Priority(1)] //ordering collections
public class Collection_A : TestCollection<Sut>
{
    const string A = nameof(Collection_A);

    [Collection(A), Priority(2)] //ordering classes within a collection
    public class Second_Class(Sut App) : TestBase
    {
        [Fact, Priority(2)] //ordering tests within the class
        public Task Fourth()
            => Task.CompletedTask;

        [Fact, Priority(1)]
        public Task Third()
            => Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    [Collection(A), Priority(1)]
    public class First_Class(Sut App) : TestBase
    {
        [Fact, Priority(1)]
        public Task First() //this test method is executed first
            => Task.CompletedTask;

        [Fact, Priority(2)]
        public Task Second()
            => Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

[CollectionDefinition(B), Priority(2)]
public class Collection_B : TestCollection<Sut>
{
    const string B = nameof(Collection_B);

    [Collection(B), Priority(2)]
    public class Second_Class(Sut App) : TestBase
    {
        [Fact, Priority(2)]
        public Task Eighth() //this test method is executed last
            => Task.CompletedTask;

        [Fact, Priority(1)]
        public Task Seventh()
            => Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    [Collection(B), Priority(1)]
    public class First_Class(Sut App) : TestBase
    {
        [Fact, Priority(1)]
        public Task Fifth()
            => Task.CompletedTask;

        [Fact, Priority(2)]
        public Task Sixth()
            => Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## Unit Testing

### Endpoint Testing With FakeItEasy

In situations where doing a unit test would be less tedious compared to setting up an integration test (or even impossible to do so), you may use the **Factory.Create&lt;TEndpoint&gt;()** method to get an instance of your endpoint which is suitable for unit testing.

```cs
[Fact]
public async Task Admin_Login_Success()
{
    // Arrange
    var fakeConfig = A.Fake<IConfiguration>();
    A.CallTo(() => fakeConfig["TokenKey"]).Returns("Fake_Token_Signing_Secret");

    var ep = Factory.Create<AdminLoginEndpoint>(
        A.Fake<ILogger<AdminLoginEndpoint>>(), //mock dependencies for injecting to the constructor
        A.Fake<IEmailService>(),
        fakeConfig);

    var req = new AdminLoginRequest
    {
        UserName = "admin",
        Password = "pass"
    };

    // Act
    await ep.HandleAsync(req, default);
    var rsp = ep.Response;

    // Assert
    Assert.IsNotNull(rsp);
    Assert.IsFalse(ep.ValidationFailed);
    Assert.IsTrue(rsp.Permissions.Contains("Inventory_Delete_Item"));
}
```

Use the **Factory.Create()** method by passing it the mocked dependencies which are needed by the endpoint constructor, if there's any. It has multiple [overloads](https://api-ref.fast-endpoints.com/api/FastEndpoints.Factory.html#FastEndpoints_Factory_Create__1_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_DefaultHttpContext_System_Object___) that enables you to instantiate endpoints with or without constructor arguments.

Then simply execute the handler by passing in a request dto and a default cancellation token.

Finally do your assertions on the **Response** property of the endpoint instance.

### Service Registration

If your endpoint (or it's dependencies) uses either [property injection](dependency-injection#property-injection) or [manual resolving](dependency-injection#manual-resolving), those services would need to be registered per test like so:

```cs
var fakeMailer = A.Fake<IEmailService>();
A.CallTo(() => fakeMailer.SendEmail())
 .Returns("test email sent");

var ep = Factory.Create<UserCreateEndpoint>(ctx =>
{
    ctx.AddTestServices(s => s.AddSingleton(fakeMailer));
});
```

It is also necessary to register any dependencies like above if your endpoint Mapper uses [dependency injection](dependency-injection#entity-mapper-dependencies) or manual resolving.

### Response DTO Returning Handler

If you prefer to return the DTO object from your handler, you can implement the **ExecuteAsync()** method instead of **HandleAsync()** like so:

```cs
public class AdminLogin : Endpoint<LoginRequest, LoginResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/admin/login");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override Task<LoginResponse> ExecuteAsync(LoginRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(
            new LoginResponse
            {
                JWTToken = "xxx",
                ExpiresOn = "yyy"
            });
    }
}
```

By doing the above, you can access the response DTO like below instead of through the Response property of the endpoint when unit testing.

```cs
var res = await ep.ExecuteAsync(req, default);
```

:::admonition type=info
Starting with .NET 7.0, you have the ability to write unit tests [like this](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/blob/81e1fc60237231d3c09f5c85ad9baa8f30e86457/Tests/UnitTests/FastEndpoints/WebTests.cs#L141-L157) by implementing **ExecuteAsync()** and returning the built-in union type as mentioned [here](get-started#union-type-returning-handler).
:::

### Adding Route Parameters

For passing down route parameters you will have to alter the **HttpContext** by setting them in the **Factory.Create**. See the example below:

```cs | title=Endpoint.cs
public class Endpoint : Endpoint<Request, Response>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("users/{id}");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(Request req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var user = new Response
        {
            Id = req.Id,
            FullName = req.FirstName + " " + req.LastName
        };

        await SendAsync(user);
    }
}

public class Request
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set;}
    public string LastName { get; set;}
}

public class Response
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
```

```cs | title=Test.cs
[Fact]
public async Task GetSingleUserById()
{
    // Arrange
    var ep = Factory.Create<Endpoint>(ctx => ctx.Request.RouteValues.Add("id", "1"));

    var req = new Request 
    {
      FirstName = "Jeff",
      LastName = "Bridges"
    };

    // Act
    await ep.HandleAsync(req, default);
    var rsp = ep.Response;

    // Assert
    Assert.IsNotNull(rsp);
    Assert.AreEqual(1, rsp.Id);
    Assert.AreEqual("Jeff Bridges", rsp.FullName);
}
```

### Units with Command executions or Event publishes

If a code path you're unit testing has command executions or event publishes, fake handlers for those commands/events can be registered as shown below.

#### Registering Fake Command Handlers

```cs
[Fact]
public async Task FakeCommandHandlerIsExecuted()
{    
    var fakeHandler = A.Fake<ICommandHandler<GetFullNameCommand, string>>();
    
    A.CallTo(() => fakeHandler.ExecuteAsync(
        A<GetFullNameCommand>.Ignored, 
        A<CancellationToken>.Ignored))
     .Returns(Task.FromResult("Fake Result"));     
    
    fakeHandler.RegisterForTesting(); //register the fake handler

    //emulating command being executed
    //typically the unit you're testing will be the executor
    var command = new GetFullNameCommand { FirstName = "a", LastName = "b" };
    var result = await command.ExecuteAsync();

    Assert.Equal("Fake Result", result);
}
```

[See here](https://gist.github.com/dj-nitehawk/f0c5c95c57ac1f1d15c936e9d87734b0) for a full example of an endpoint that executes a command being unit tested.

#### Registering Fake Event Handlers

```cs
[Fact]
public async Task FakeEventHandlerIsExecuted()
{
    var fakeHandler = new FakeEventHandler();

    Factory.RegisterTestServices( //register fake handler
        s =>
        {
            s.AddSingleton<IEventHandler<NewItemAddedToStock>>(fakeHandler);
        });

    //emulating event being published
    //typically the unit you're testing will be the publisher
    await new NewItemAddedToStock { Name = "xyz" }.PublishAsync();

    fakeHandler.Name.Should().Be("xyz");
}
```

[See here](https://gist.github.com/dj-nitehawk/8ab7bb4ce5b69152b07b9186d7c40e40) for a full example of an endpoint that publishes an event being unit tested.
