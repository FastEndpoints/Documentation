## Integration Testing

### Route-less Testing

The recommended integration/end-to-end testing stratergy is to use the following packages:
- [xUnit.net](https://xunit.net/)
- [WebApplicationFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests)
- [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/)

FastEndpoints comes with a set of extension methods for the **HttpClient** to make testing more convenient in a strongly-typed and route-less manner. I.e. you don't need to specify the route URLs when testing endpoints.

### Walkthrough

The quickest way to get going is to scaffold a starter project using our [Template Pack](scaffolding#project-scaffolding).
If you aren't ready to scaffold a project yet, follow along with the code [here](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/tree/main/templates/project).

```sh title=install & scaffold | copy
dotnet new install FastEndpoints.TemplatePack
dotnet new feproj -n E2EWalkthrough
```

#### Solution Setup

There are two projects in the solution. The main application is in the [Source](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/main/templates/project/Source) folder and the actual test project is in the [Tests](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/tree/main/templates/project/Tests) folder. 

The main project doesn't reference the test project. The test project [references the main project](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/fded80f9809260763480905d3af355439349fedb/templates/project/Tests/Tests.csproj#L24) so it can access the Endpoint/Request/Response classes.

The Endpoints and DTOs are internal so we expose internal classes of the main project to the test project via an [assembly attribute](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/fded80f9809260763480905d3af355439349fedb/templates/project/Source/Metadata.cs#L5C1-L5C40):

```cs title=Metadata.cs
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Tests")]
```

We are using a derived [WebApplicationFactory&lt;T&gt;](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/Template-Pack/blob/fded80f9809260763480905d3af355439349fedb/templates/project/Tests/Fixtures/AppFixture.cs#L21) which bootstraps our main application as an in-memory test-server (web-host). This WAF is used as a [Class Fixture](https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#class-fixture) which in simple terms is just a shared context which will be accessible to all the tests in a single test-class. I.e. the same in-memory app instance is accessible to all tests (test-methods) of the test-class. We're doing this to speed up test-runs since constantly booting up and tearing down the WAF per each test-method execution would slow down test execution. If your project has hundreds of test-classes, it might pay to investigate [Collection Fixture](https://xunit.net/docs/shared-context#collection-fixture) and [Assembly Fixture](https://github.com/xunit/samples.xunit/tree/main/AssemblyFixtureExample) in order to reduce the number of WAF instances. With the Class Fixture approach, an instance is created per each test-class in your project, which gives acceptable performance in most cases.

```cs title=ClassFixture.cs
public sealed class AppFixture : WebApplicationFactory<Program>
{
    public HttpClient GuestClient { get; private set; }

    public AppFixture()
    {
        InitClients();
    }

    protected override void ConfigureWebHost(IWebHostBuilder b)
    {
        b.ConfigureTestServices(s =>
        {
            // swap/override services used for testing
            s.AddSingleton<IEmailService, MockEmailService>();
        });
    }

    private void InitClients()
    {
        // setup pre-configured clients/actors here
        GuestClient = CreateClient();
    }
}
```

There's also a base test-class which gives us convenient access to the WAF and the pre-configured HttpClients:
```cs title TestBase.cs
public abstract class TestBase : IClassFixture<AppFixture>
{
    protected AppFixture App { get; init; }

    protected TestBase(AppFixture fixture)
    {
        App = fixture;
    }
}
``` 

With the fixture and base class in place, we can write our integration tests like so:
```cs title=MyTests.cs
public class MyTests : TestBase
{
    public MyTests(AppFixture fixture) : base(fixture) { }

    [Fact]
    public async Task Invalid_User_Input()
    {
        // Arrange
        var req = new Request
        {
            FirstName = "x",
            LastName = "y"
        };

        // Act
        var (rsp, res) = await App.GuestClient.POSTAsync<Endpoint, Request, ErrorResponse>(req);

        // Assert
        rsp.StatusCode.Should().Be(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
        res.Errors.Count.Should().Be(2);
        res.Errors["firstName"][0].Contains("invalid length");
        res.Errors["lastName"][0].Contains("invalid length");
    }
}
```

Everything up until now is pretty standard in the ASP.NET world. The only FastEndpoints specific thing in the above test code is the **POSTAsync** method.
It has 3 generic parameters.

- The type of the Endpoint class (endpoint's route URL is not needed)
- The type of the Request DTO class
- The type of the Response DTO class

The method argument takes an instance of a populated Request DTO and Returns a record class containing the **HttpResponseMessage** and the **Response** DTO of the endpoint, 
with which you can do your assertions.

There are [other such methods](https://api-ref.fast-endpoints.com/api/FastEndpoints.HttpClientExtensions.html#methods) you can use to send requests to your endpoints.

## Unit Testing
### Endpoint Testing With FakeItEasy

In situations where doing a unit test would be less tedious compared to setting up an integration test (or even impossible to do so), you may use the **Factory.Create&lt;TEndpoint&gt;()** method to get an instance of your endpoint which is suitable for unit testing.

```cs
[Fact]
public async Task Admin_Login_Success()
{
    // Arrange
    var fakeConfig = A.Fake<IConfiguration>();
    A.CallTo(() => fakeConfig["TokenKey"]).Returns("Fake_Token_Signing_Secret");

    var ep = Factory.Create<AdminLoginEndpoint>(
        A.Fake<ILogger<AdminLoginEndpoint>>(), //mock dependencies for injecting to the constructor
        A.Fake<IEmailService>(),
        fakeConfig);

    var req = new AdminLoginRequest
    {
        UserName = "admin",
        Password = "pass"
    };

    // Act
    await ep.HandleAsync(req, default);
    var rsp = ep.Response;

    // Assert
    Assert.IsNotNull(rsp);
    Assert.IsFalse(ep.ValidationFailed);
    Assert.IsTrue(rsp.Permissions.Contains("Inventory_Delete_Item"));
}
```

Use the **Factory.Create()** method by passing it the mocked dependencies which are needed by the endpoint constructor, if there's any. It has multiple [overloads](https://api-ref.fast-endpoints.com/api/FastEndpoints.Factory.html#FastEndpoints_Factory_Create__1_Microsoft_AspNetCore_Http_DefaultHttpContext_System_Object___) that enables you to instantiate endpoints with or without constructor arguments.

Then simply execute the handler by passing in a request dto and a default cancellation token.

Finally do your assertions on the **Response** property of the endpoint instance.

### Service Registration

If your endpoint (or it's dependencies) uses either [property injection](dependency-injection#property-injection) or [manual resolving](dependency-injection#manual-resolving),  those services would need to be registered per test like so:
```cs
var fakeMailer = A.Fake<IEmailService>();
A.CallTo(() => fakeMailer.SendEmail())
 .Returns("test email sent");

var ep = Factory.Create<UserCreateEndpoint>(ctx =>
{
    ctx.AddTestServices(s => s.AddSingleton(fakeMailer));
});
```

### Endpoints With Mappers

When unit testing an endpoint that has a mapper, you have to set it yourself via the **Map** property like so:
```cs
var ep = Factory.Create<MyEndpoint>();
ep.Map = new MyMapper();
```

### Response DTO Returning Handler

If you prefer to return the DTO object from your handler, you can implement the **ExecuteAsync()** method instead of **HandleAsync()** like so:

```cs
public class AdminLogin : Endpoint<LoginRequest, LoginResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/admin/login");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override Task<LoginResponse> ExecuteAsync(LoginRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return Task.FromResult(
            new LoginResponse
            {
                JWTToken = "xxx",
                ExpiresOn = "yyy"
            });
    }
}
```

By doing the above, you can access the response DTO like below instead of through the Response property of the endpoint when unit testing.

```cs
var res = await ep.ExecuteAsync(req, default);
```

:::admonition type=info
Starting with .NET 7.0, you have the ability to write unit tests [like this](https://github.com/FastEndpoints/FastEndpoints/blob/81e1fc60237231d3c09f5c85ad9baa8f30e86457/Tests/UnitTests/FastEndpoints/WebTests.cs#L141-L157) by implementing **ExecuteAsync()** and returning the built-in union type as mentioned [here](get-started#union-type-returning-handler).
:::

### Adding Route Parameters

For passing down route parameters you will have to alter the **HttpContext** by setting them in the **Factory.Create**. See the example below:
#### Endpoint
```cs
public class Endpoint : Endpoint<Request, Response>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("users/{id}");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(Request req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var user = new Response
        {
            Id = req.Id,
            FullName = req.FirstName + " " + req.LastName
        };

        await SendAsync(user);
    }
}

public class Request
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set;}
    public string LastName { get; set;}
}

public class Response
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
```

#### Test
```cs
[Fact]
public async Task GetSingleUserById()
{
    // Arrange
    var ep = Factory.Create<Endpoint>(ctx =>
      ctx.Request.RouteValues.Add("id", "1"));

    var req = new Request 
    {
      FirstName = "Jeff",
      LastName = "Bridges"
    };

    // Act
    await ep.HandleAsync(req, default);
    var rsp = ep.Response;

    // Assert
    Assert.IsNotNull(rsp);
    Assert.AreEqual(1, rsp.Id);
    Assert.AreEqual("Jeff Bridges", rsp.FullName);
}
```
