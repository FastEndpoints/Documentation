# Native AOT Publishing

FastEndpoints applications can be compiled down to a self-contained native binary that can be executed on either Windows, Linux or macOS without the .NET Runtime being present on the machine. Native AOT compiled apps generally "tend" to be smaller, uses less memory, and starts up faster, at the expense of losing runtime performance optimizations provided by the JIT Compiler and taking much longer to publish, as well as requiring the developer to jump through a few hoops to ensure compatibility with AOT compilation. FastEndpoints takes away much of the pain with automated source generation, but requires the project to be setup in a certain way.

## Install Prerequisites

### Visual Studio Users

Make sure you're on Visual Studio 2026 or later and install the **Desktop development with C++** workload with all default components.

### Rider/VS Code Users

#### On Windows

- Download [VS Build Tools](https://aka.ms/vs/stable/vs_BuildTools.exe)
- Download [this zip file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24822561/build-tools-install-scripts.zip) with two CMD files and extract them to the same folder where **vs_BuildTools.exe** is located.
- Execute **download.cmd** which will first create an offline layout with the required files.
- Execute **install.cmd** which will do the actual installation from the created layout.

#### On Linux

Install the dependencies according to which flavor of Linux you're on:

```ini
# Arch
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel clang zlib krb5 icu

# Debian
sudo apt-get install clang zlib1g-dev

# Alpine
sudo apk add clang build-base zlib-dev

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install clang zlib-devel zlib-ng-devel zlib-ng-compat-devel
```

#### On macOS

Install the [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Command%20Line%20Tools) for Xcode.

## Project Setup

:::admonition type=tip
If you prefer to scaffold a new project that's already primed for AOT publishing, simply do the following:

```sh copy
dotnet new install FastEndpoints.TemplatePack
dotnet new feaot -n MyProject
```

Have a quick read through the following so you know what's involved in developing and publishing a Native AOT application.

:::

If you'd like to start from scratch, create a new Web project and install the necessary nuget packages:

```sh copy
dotnet new web -n MyWebApp
cd MyWebApp

dotnet add package FastEndpoints
dotnet add package FastEndpoints.Generator
dotnet add package FastEndpoints.Swagger
dotnet add package Scalar.AspNetCore
```

### Enable AOT Publishing

```xml title=MyWebApp.csproj | copy

<PropertyGroup>
    <PublishAot>true</PublishAot>
    <InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization> <!-- optional but recommended -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Enable Source Generation

Native AOT publishing requires source generation due to runtime reflection/compilation being unavailable.

#### JsonSerializerContext Generation

Typically in ASP.NET, when you develop an AOT compiled application, it requires you to manually create and manage STJ JsonSerializerContexts for your endpoints and wire them up yourself in startup code. **FastEndpoints.Generator** includes a tool that automatically generates the JsonSerializerContexts everytime you build the application. An extension method is also generated which helps to wire it up with the serializer options during startup with a single call.

Enable serializer context generation in the csproj file like so:

```xml title=MyWebApp.csproj | copy

<PropertyGroup>
    <GenerateSerializerContexts>true</GenerateSerializerContexts>
    <SerializerContextOutputPath>Generated/SerializerCtx</SerializerContextOutputPath> <!-- optional -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

Serializer context generation is not the same as typical source generation and the generated files must be considered as code you've written yourself and should be checked in to source control. This is due to a limitation in .NET source generation which prevents incremental source generators from being chained. FastEndpoints work around this limitation by using a locally installed development time only CLI tool.

#### Use Slim Builder and Type Discovery Generator

Use the slim app builder and register the source generator discovered types.

```csharp title=Program.cs | copy
var bld = WebApplication.CreateSlimBuilder(args);
bld.Services.AddFastEndpoints(o => o.SourceGeneratorDiscoveredTypes = DiscoveredTypes.All)
```

#### Register Generated SerializerContext & Reflection Data

Hook up the generated serializer contexts and reflection data. The extension method names will have your assembly name at the end. If your endpoints/DTOs are located in separate projects, install the **FastEndpoints.Generator** library on each one, and call each generated extension method from those projects.

```csharp title=Program.cs | copy
app.UseFastEndpoints(
    c =>
    {
        c.Serializer.Options.AddSerializerContextsFromMyWebApp();
        c.Binding.ReflectionCache.AddFromMyWebApp();
    });
```

## Publish AOT Executable

The above is all the basic setup needed to be able to publish an AOT compiled executable. Add a couple of endpoints to the app and fire off a "publish" with the following dotnet command:

```sh
dotnet publish MyWebApp.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 -o dist
```
