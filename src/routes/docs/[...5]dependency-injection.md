# {$frontmatter.title}

There are three different ways to get access to services registered in the IOC container.
Consider the following service registration.

```cs |title=HelloWorldService.cs
public interface IHelloWorldService
{
    string SayHello();
}

public class HelloWorldService : IHelloWorldService
{
    public string SayHello() => "hello world!";
}
```

**IOC Registration**

```cs |title=Program.cs
bld.Services.AddScoped<IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService>();
```

## Property Injection

Services can be automatically property injected by simply adding properties to the endpoint like so:

```cs |title=MyEndpoint.cs
public class MyEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest
{
    public IHelloWorldService HelloService { get; set; }

    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("/api/hello-world");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await SendAsync(HelloService.SayHello());
    }
}
```

[Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0#keyed-services) can be property
injected like so:

```csharp
[KeyedService("KeyName")]
public IHelloWorldService HelloService { get; set; }
```

## Constructor Injection

Constructor injection is also supported. Just make sure not to assign the injected dependencies to public properties if using together with property injection.

```cs |title=MyEndpoint.cs
public class MyEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest
{
    private IHelloWorldService _helloService;

    public MyEndpoint(IHelloWorldService helloScv)
    {
        _helloService = helloScv;
    }

    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("/api/hello-world");
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
    {
        await SendAsync(_helloService.SayHello());
    }
}

```

[Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0#keyed-services) can be constructor injected like so:

```csharp
public MyEndpoint([FromKeyedServices("KeyName")]IHelloWorldService helloScv)
{
    ...
}
```

## Manual Resolving

Services can be resolved manually like so:

```cs
public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
{
    IHelloWorldService? helloSvc = TryResolve<IHelloWorldService>();

    if (helloSvc is null)
        ThrowError("service not resolved!");

    var logger = Resolve<ILogger<MyEndpoint>>();

    logger.LogInformation("hello service is resolved...");

    await SendAsync(helloSvc.SayHello());
}
```

- **TryResolve()** - This method will try to resolve the given service. returns null if not resolved.

- **Resolve()** - This method will throw an exception if the requested service cannot be resolved.

[Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-8.0#keyed-services) can be manually resolved like so:

```csharp
Resolve<IHelloWorldService>("KeyName");
```

## Pre-Resolved Services

The following services are pre-resolved and available for every endpoint handler with the following properties:

```
property: Config
service : IConfiguration

property: Env
service : IWebHostEnvironment

property: Logger
service : ILogger
```

They can be used in the endpoint handlers like so:

```cs
public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken ct)
{
    Logger.LogInformation("this is a log message");
    var isProduction = Env.IsProduction();
    var smtpServer = Config["SMTP:HostName"];
}
```

## Validator Dependencies

Validators are singletons for [performance reasons](/benchmarks). Constructor injection as well as the above-mentioned **\*Resolve()** methods are available for
validators to get access to the dependencies. Take care not to maintain state in the validator unless that data is also singleton/static.

Trying to resolve a scoped dependency in the constructor will cause an error to be thrown. Scoped dependencies can be resolved in the constructor by creating a new scope
and disposing it as shown below:

```cs title=MyValidator.cs
public class MyValidator : Validator<Request>
{
    public MyValidator(ISomeSingletonService singletonService)
    {
        var singletonSvc = singletonService; //from ctor injection
        var anotherSingletonService = Resolve<IAnotherSingletonService>(); //manual resolving

        //scoped dependency resolving
        using var scope = CreateScope();
        var scopedService = scope.Resolve<ISomeScopedService>();
    }
}
```

Most importantly don't forget the **using** keyword or manually dispose the **scope** at the end.

You can however call **\*Resolve()** when needing to access scoped dependencies inside the rules without having to create a new scope on each execution. The same scope as
the current http context scope is used in this case.

```cs
public class MyValidator : Validator<Request>
{
    public MyValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Id).MustAsync(async (id, ct) =>
        {
            var idChecker = Resolve<IScopedService>();
            return await idChecker.IsValidId(id, ct);
        });
    }
}
```

## Entity Mapper Dependencies

Just like validators, mappers are also singletons and you need to create a scope and dispose it if you need to resolve scoped dependencies in the constructor.

```cs title=MyMapper.cs
public class MyMapper : Mapper<Request, Response, Person>
{
    public MyMapper(ISomeSingletonService singletonService)
    {
        var singletonSvc = singletonService; //from ctor injection
        var anotherSingletonService = Resolve<IAnotherSingletonService>(); //manual resolving

        //scoped dependency resolving
        using var scope = CreateScope();
        var scopedService = scope.Resolve<ISomeScopedService>();
    }
}
```

Non-constructor methods can call **\*Resolve()** when needing to access scoped dependencies without having to create a new scope on each execution. The same scope as the
current http context scope is used.

```cs
public class Mapper : Mapper<Request, Response, Person>
{
    public override Task<Person> ToEntityAsync(Request r)
    {
        var db = Resolve<DbContext>();
        return db.GetPerson(r.Id);
    }
}
```

## Pre/Post Processor Dependencies

Processors are also singletons, and they support both constructor injection and resolving via **HttpContext**. Since the constructor is only ever executed once, you
must inject an **IServiceScopeFactory** and use that to create a scope in order to resolve scoped dependencies inside the *ProcessAsync methods. Scoped dependencies can
also be resolved via the **HttpContext** without the need for an **IServiceScopeFactory**. Singleton dependencies can be injected as usual in the constructor.

```cs title=MyRequestLogger.cs
public class MyRequestLogger<TRequest> : IPreProcessor<TRequest>
{
    readonly IServiceScopeFactory _scopeFactory;

    public MyRequestLogger(IServiceScopeFactory scopeFactory, ILogger<TRequest> logger)
    {
        _scopeFactory = scopeFactory;
        logger.LogInformation("this will only be logged once");
    }

    public async Task PreProcessAsync(IPreProcessorContext<TRequest> ctx, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var serviceA = ctx.HttpContext.Resolve<IScopedServiceA>();

        using var scope = _scopeFactory.CreateScope();
        var serviceB = scope.Resolve<IScopedServiceB>();
    }
}
```

## Event Handler Dependencies

Event handlers are also singletons, and they only support constructor injection. Since the constructor is only ever executed once, you must inject an
**IServiceScopeFactory** and use that to create a scope in order to resolve scoped dependencies in the HandleAsync method. Singleton dependencies can be injected as
usual in the constructor.

```cs title=MyEventHandler.cs
public class MyEventHandler : IEventHandler<MyEvent>
{
    private readonly IServiceScopeFactory _scopeFactory;

    public MyEventHandler(IServiceScopeFactory scopeFactory, ILogger<MyEventHandler> logger)
    {
        _scopeFactory = scopeFactory;
        logger.LogInformation("this will only be logged once");
    }

    public async Task HandleAsync(MyEvent eventModel, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        using var scope = _scopeFactory.CreateScope();
        var service = scope.Resolve<IScopedService>();
        await service.DoSomething();
    }
}
```

## Command Handler Dependencies

Unlike event handlers, command handlers are not singletons and the constructor is executed per each command execution. Scoped dependencies can therefore simply be
injected using the constructor and used inside the execute method like so:

```cs
public class MyCommandHandler : ICommandHandler<MyCommand, string>
{
    private readonly IScopedService _scopedService;

    public MyCommandHandler(IScopedService scopedService, ILogger<MyCommandHandler> logger)
    {
        _scopedService = scopedService;
        logger.LogInformation("this will logged on each execution");
    }

    public async Task<string> ExecuteAsync(MyCommand command, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return await _scopedService.GetSomething();
    }
}
```

:::admonition type=note
If the command handler execution happens outside the duration of an http request and it needs to access a scoped dependency, an exception will be thrown. In such
situations you can inject an **IServiceScopeFactory** in the constructor and create a scope as described in the event handler section above. I.e. the need for a scope
factory would only arise if/when you execute commands outside of endpoints.

## Source Generated Service Registrations

Instead of manually registering services at startup, you can have our source generator automatically generate a single service registration extension method per assembly
just by annotating the individual services with an attribute. Specify the service type as the generic argument of the attribute and the service lifetime using the
**LifeTime** enum in the attribute constructor.

```cs
[RegisterService<IHelloWorldService>(LifeTime.Scoped)]
public class HelloWorldService : IHelloWorldService
{
    ...
}
```

The source generator will create an extension method containing all the services from the assembly.

```cs | title="Generated Code:"
public static class ServiceRegistrationExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection RegisterServicesFromMyProject(this IServiceCollection sc)
    {
        sc.AddScoped<IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService>();
        ...
    }
}
```

The generated extension method name will end with the name of your assembly. If the services are in multiple projects, you can add the source generator to each one and
separate extension methods will be created per assembly.

Installation of the source generator can be done from Nuget like so:

```sh | copy
dotnet add package FastEndpoints.Generator
```
