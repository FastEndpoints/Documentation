## Securing Endpoints

Endpoints are secure by default and you'd have to call **AllowAnonymous()** in the configuration if you'd like to allow unauthenticated users to access a particular endpoint.

## JWT Bearer Authentication

Support for easy JWT Bearer Authentication is provided.
You simply need to install the **FastEndpoints.Security** package and register it in the middleware pipeline like so:

```cs | copy | title=terminal
  dotnet add package FastEndpoints.Security
```

```cs |copy|title=Program.cs
global using FastEndpoints;
global using FastEndpoints.Security; //add this

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder();
builder.Services.AddFastEndpoints();
builder.Services.AddJWTBearerAuth("TokenSigningKey"); //add this

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseAuthentication(); //add this
app.UseAuthorization();
app.UseFastEndpoints();
app.Run();
```

## Generating JWT Tokens

You can generate a JWT token for sending to the client with an endpoint that signs in users like so:

```cs
public class UserLoginEndpoint : Endpoint<LoginRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/api/login");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(LoginRequest req, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        if (await authService.CredentialsAreValid(req.Username, req.Password, ct))
        {
            var jwtToken = JWTBearer.CreateToken(
                signingKey: "TokenSigningKey",
                expireAt: DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(1),
                claims: new[] { ("Username", req.Username), ("UserID", "001") },
                roles: new[] { "Admin", "Manager" },
                permissions: new[] { "ManageInventory", "ManageUsers" });

            await SendAsync(new
            {
                Username = req.Username,
                Token = jwtToken
            });
        }
        else
        {
            ThrowError("The supplied credentials are invalid!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Endpoint Authorization

Once an authentication provider is registered such as JWT Bearer as shown above, you can restrict access to users based on the following:

- **Policies**
- **Claims**
- **Roles**
- **Permissions**

## Pre-Built Security Policies

Security policies can be pre-built and registered during app startup and endpoints can choose to allow access to users based on the registered policy names like so:

```cs title=Program.cs

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("ManagersOnly", x => x.RequireRole("Manager").RequireClaim("ManagerID"));
})
```

```cs title=UpdateUserEndpoint.cs
public class UpdateUserEndpoint : Endpoint<UpdateUserRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Put("/api/users/update");
        Policies("ManagersOnly");
    }
}
```

## Declarative Security Policies

Instead of registering each security policy at startup you can selectively specify security requirements for each endpoint in the endpoint configuration itself like so:

```cs title=RestrictedEndpoint.cs
public class RestrictedEndpoint : Endpoint<RestrictedRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/api/restricted");
        Claims("AdminID", "EmployeeID");
        Roles("Admin", "Manager");
        Permissions("UpdateUsersPermission", "DeleteUsersPermission");
    }
}
```

### Claims() method
With this method you are specifying that if a user principal has ANY of the specified claims, access should be allowed. if the requirement is to allow access only if ALL specified claims are present, you can use the **ClaimsAll()** method.

### Permissions() method
Just like above, you can specify that ANY of the specified permissions should allow access. Or require ALL of the specified permissions by using the **PermissionsAll()** method.

### Roles() method
Similarly, you are specifying that ANY of the given roles should allow access to a user principal who has it.

### AllowAnonymous() method
Use this method if you'd like to allow unauthenticated users to access a particular endpoint. 

It is also possible to specify which http verbs you'd like to allow anonymous access to if you're endpoint is listening on [multiple verbs & routes](misc-conveniences#multiple-verbs-routes) like so:

```cs title=RestrictedEndpoint.cs
public class RestrictedEndpoint : Endpoint<RestrictedRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Verbs(Http.POST, Http.PUT, Http.PATCH);
        Routes("/api/restricted");
        AllowAnonymous(Http.POST);
    }
}
```

The above endpoint is listening for all 3 http methods on the same route but only **POST** method is allowed to be accessed anonymously.
It is useful for example when you'd like to use the same handler logic for create/replace/update scenarios and create operation is allowed to be done by anonymous users.

Using just **AllowAnonymous()** without any arguments means all verbs are allowed anonymous access.

## Other Auth Providers

All auth providers compatible with the ASP.NET middleware pipeline can be registered and used like above.

Here's an [example project](https://github.com/dj-nitehawk/FastEndpoints-Auth0-Demo) using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/access-management) with permissions.

## Multiple Authentication Schemes

It is possible to register multiple auth schemes at startup and specify per endpoint which schemes are to be used for authenticating incoming requests.

```cs title=Program.cs
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =>
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie(options => options.SlidingExpiration = true) // cookie auth
.AddJwtBearer(options =>                                // jwt bearer auth
{
    options.Authority = $"https://{builder.Configuration["Auth0:Domain"]}/";
    options.Audience = builder.Configuration["Auth0:Audience"];
});
```

```cs title=Endpoint.cs
public override void Configure()
{
    Get("/account/profile");
    AuthSchemes(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
```

In the above example, we're registering both **Cookie** and **JWT Bearer** auth schemes and in the endpoint we're saying **only JWT Bearer** auth scheme should be used for authenticating incoming requests to the endpoint.
You can specify multiple schemes and if an incoming request isn't using any of the said schemes, access will not be allowed.

## JWT Refresh Tokens

Implementing refresh tokens in FastEndpoints is a simple 2-step process.

### Step 1 - Login Endpoint:
Create a user login endpoint which checks the supplied user credentials such as username/password and issues an initial pair of access & refresh tokens.

```cs | title="LoginEndpoint.cs"
public class LoginEndpoint : EndpointWithoutRequest<TokenResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Get("/api/login");
        AllowAnonymous();
    }

    public override async Task HandleAsync(CancellationToken c)
    {
        //user credential checking has been omitted for brevity

        Response = await CreateTokenWith<MyTokenService>("user-id-001", u =>
        {
            u.Roles.AddRange(new[] { "Admin", "Manager" });
            u.Permissions.Add("Update_Something");
            u.Claims.Add(new("UserId", "user-id-001"));
        });
    }
}
```
The interesting bits of info here would be the following:
- **CreateTokenWith&lt;TTokenService&gt;()**: This is a method supplied by the endpoint base class which can be used to generate the initial response dto containing the access/refresh token pair. The token service is discussed below. The parameters of the method would be the user-id and an action for configuring which user privileges (roles/claims/permissions) are to be embedded in the generated access token.
- **MyTokenService**: This is your implementation of a specialized abstract endpoint class which is configured with the relevant settings such as singing key/ audience/ issuer/ expiry times/ etc. See example below.
- **TokenResponse**: This is the the response dto that the token service will return when token generation succeeds.

### Step 2 - Token Service:

A token service is created by implementing the **RefreshTokenService&lt;TRequest, TResponse&gt;** abstract class. This class is a bit different from the typical endpoint classes that it is configured by calling **Setup()** in the constructor as shown below. Also the request and response dto generic arguments are constrained to **TokenRequest** & **TokenResponse** even though you are free to subclass those types if you need to add more properties. In addition to the endpoint setup, you need to implement 3 abstract methods as explained below. There is no **HandleAsync()** method like in a regular endpoint.

```cs | title=MyTokenService.cs
public class MyTokenService : RefreshTokenService<TokenRequest, TokenResponse>
{
    public MyTokenService(IConfiguration config)
    {
        Setup(o =>
        {
            o.TokenSigningKey = config["TokenSigningKey"];
            o.AccessTokenValidity = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
            o.RefreshTokenValidity = TimeSpan.FromHours(4);

            o.Endpoint("/api/refresh-token", ep =>
            {
                ep.Summary(s => s.Summary = "this is the refresh token endpoint");
            });
        });
    }

    public override async Task PersistTokenAsync(TokenResponse response)
    {
        await Data.StoreToken(response);

        // this method will be called whenever a new access/refresh token pair is being generated.
        // store the tokens and expiry dates however you wish for the purpose of verifying
        // future refresh requests.        
    }

    public override async Task RefreshRequestValidationAsync(TokenRequest req)
    {
        if (!await Data.TokenIsValid(req.UserId, req.RefreshToken))
            AddError(r => r.RefreshToken, "Refresh token is invalid!");

        // validate the incoming refresh request by checking the token and expiry against the
        // previously stored data. if the token is not valid and a new token pair should
        // not be created, simply add validation errors using the AddError() method.
        // the failures you add will be sent to the requesting client. if no failures are added,
        // validation passes and a new token pair will be created and sent to the client.        
    }

    public override Task SetRenewalPrivilegesAsync(TokenRequest request, UserPrivileges privileges)
    {
        privileges.Roles.Add("Manager");
        privileges.Claims.Add(new("ManagerID", request.UserId));
        privileges.Permissions.Add("Manage_Department");

        // specify the user privileges to be embedded in the jwt when a refresh request is
        // received and validation has passed. this only applies to renewal/refresh requests
        // received to the refresh endpoint and not the initial jwt creation.        
    }
}
```
