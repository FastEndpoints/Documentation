# Job Queues With Commands

Work that can be processed in the background such as sending emails, pdf generation, report creation, etc. that doesn't require a result to be available immediately would be prime candidates for the **Job Queue** functionality in FastEndpoints. 

Job queues allow you to schedule [Commands](command-bus#_1-define-a-command) to be executed in the background while limiting how many command instances of the same type can be executed at the same time. It is sometimes crucial to be in control of the degree of parallelism for certain types of long-running or CPU intensive tasks to prevent the server from grinding to a halt, as well as to stay within access control limits of third-party services.
