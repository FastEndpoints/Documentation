title: Pre / Post Processors
description: Writing shared common logic with many endpoints with pre/post processors in FastEndpoints opens up a world of possibility.

# {$frontmatter.title}

Rather than writing a common piece of logic repeatedly that must be executed either before or after each request to your system, you can write it as a processor and attach it to endpoints that need them.

There are two types of processors:

- **Pre Processors**
- **Post Processors**

## Pre Processors

Let's say for example that you'd like to log every request before being executed by your endpoint handlers.

You can simply write a pre-processor like below by implementing the interface **IPreProcessor&lt;TRequest&gt;**:

```cs |title=MyRequestLogger.cs
public class MyRequestLogger<TRequest> : IPreProcessor<TRequest>
{
    public Task PreProcessAsync(TRequest req, HttpContext ctx, List<ValidationFailure> failures, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var logger = ctx.Resolve<ILogger<TRequest>>();

        logger.LogInformation($"request:{req?.GetType().FullName} path: {ctx.Request.Path}");

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

And then attach it to the endpoints you need like so:

```cs |title=CreateOrderEndpoint.cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateOrderRequest>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/sales/orders/create");
        PreProcessors(new MyRequestLogger<CreateOrderRequest>()); // add this
    }
}
```

You can even write a request DTO specific processor like so:

```cs |title=SalesRequestLogger.cs
public class SalesRequestLogger : IPreProcessor<CreateSaleRequest>
{
    public Task PreProcessAsync(CreateSaleRequest req, HttpContext ctx, List<ValidationFailure> failures, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var logger = ctx.Resolve<ILogger<CreateSaleRequest>>();

        logger.LogInformation($"sale value:{req.SaleValue}");

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## Short-Circuiting Execution

It is possible to end processing the request by returning a response from within a pre-processor like so:

```cs |title=SecurityProcessor.cs
public class SecurityProcessor<TRequest> : IPreProcessor<TRequest>
{
    public Task PreProcessAsync(TRequest req, HttpContext ctx, List<ValidationFailure> failures, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var tenantID = ctx.Request.Headers["tenant-id"].FirstOrDefault();

        if (tenantID == null)
        {
            failures.Add(new("MissingHeaders", "The [tenant-id] header needs to be set!"));
            return ctx.Response.SendErrorsAsync(failures); //sending response here
        }

        if (tenantID != "qwerty")
            return ctx.Response.SendForbiddenAsync(); //sending response here

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

All the [Send\* methods](misc-conveniences#send-methods) supported by endpoint handlers are available.
The send methods are accessed from the **ctx.Response** property as shown above.
When a response is sent from a pre-processor, the handler method is not executed.

:::admonition type="note"
If there are multiple pre-processors configured, they will be executed. if another pre-processor also wants to send a response, they must check if it's possible to do so by checking the property **ctx.Response.HasStarted** to see if a previously executed pre-processor has already sent a response to the client.
:::

## Post Processors

Post-processors are executed after your endpoint handler has completed it's work.
They can be created similarly by implementing the interface **IPostProcessor&lt;TRequest, TResponse&gt;**:

```cs
public class MyResponseLogger<TRequest, TResponse> : IPostProcessor<TRequest, TResponse>
{
    public Task PostProcessAsync(TRequest req, TResponse res, HttpContext ctx, IReadOnlyCollection<ValidationFailure> failures, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        var logger = ctx.Resolve<ILogger<TResponse>>();

        if (res is CreateSaleResponse response)
        {
            logger.LogWarning($"sale complete: {response.OrderID}");
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

And then attach it to endpoints like so:

```cs
public class CreateOrderEndpoint : Endpoint<CreateSaleRequest, CreateSaleResponse>
{
    public override void Configure()
    {
        Post("/sales/orders/create");
        PostProcessors(new MyResponseLogger<CreateSaleRequest, CreateSaleResponse>());
    }
}
```

## Multiple Processors

You can attach multiple processors with both **PreProcessors()** and **PostProcessors()** methods.

The processors are executed in the order they are supplied to the methods.

## Global Processors

Global pre/post processors that operate on multiple endpoints can be created implementing the **IGlobalPreProcessor** & **IGlobalPostProcessor** interfaces. 

```cs copy|title=TenantIDChecker.cs
public class TenantIDChecker : IGlobalPreProcessor
{
    public async Task PreProcessAsync(object req, HttpContext ctx, List<ValidationFailure> failures, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        if (req is MyRequest r) //can work on specific dto types if desired
        {
            var tID = ctx.Request.Headers["x-tenant-id"];
            if (tID.Count > 0)
            {
                r.TenantID = tID[0];
            }
            else
            {
                failures.Add(new("TenandID", "Unable to retrieve tenant id from header!"));
                if (!ctx.Response.HasStarted)
                    await ctx.Response.SendErrorsAsync(failures);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To attach the above pre-processor to all endpoints, add it in the global endpoint configurator function like so:

```cs copy|title=Program.cs
app.UseFastEndpoints(c =>
{
    c.Endpoints.Configurator = ep =>
    {
        ep.PreProcessors(new TenantIDChecker());
    };
});
```

Global processors are run before any of the processors you have configured in the endpoint class itself.

## Dependency Injection
Processors are singletons for [performance reasons](/benchmarks). I.e. there will only ever be one instance of a processor. You should not maintain state in them. Dependencies can be resolved  as shown [here](dependency-injection#pre-post-processor-dependencies).
